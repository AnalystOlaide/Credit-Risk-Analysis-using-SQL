## Credit Risk SQL Analysis


## üìÑ Project Overview

This project analyzes the credit application and repayment behavior of customers from a fictional credit-lending institution. It answers business-critical questions around **loan approvals**, **repayment patterns**, **cumulative risk exposure**, and **data quality** using advanced SQL techniques. The goal is to help the credit company **identify risk-prone customers**, **track loan performance**, and **optimize approval decisions**.


## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Credit lenders must proactively evaluate **applicant reliability** and **repayment behavior** to avoid loan defaults. This project uses structured data to provide insights such as:

* Who pays late and how often?
* Which loan types or purposes have high or low approval and credit scores?
* Which customers have built a strong repayment record over time?


## Data Source

**Tables Used:**

* `credit_applications`: Contains demographic, loan, and credit information for each customer
* `payment_history`: Contains all customer payments with date, amount, and late status


## Tools Used

* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Techniques**:
  `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `CASE`, `EXTRACT`, `DATE_TRUNC`, `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`, `UPDATE`, `IS NULL`, `LIKE`
