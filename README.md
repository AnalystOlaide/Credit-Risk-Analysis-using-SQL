## Credit Risk SQL Analysis


## 📄 Project Overview

This project analyzes the credit application and repayment behavior of customers from a fictional credit-lending institution. It answers business-critical questions around **loan approvals**, **repayment patterns**, **cumulative risk exposure**, and **data quality** using advanced SQL techniques. The goal is to help the credit company **identify risk-prone customers**, **track loan performance**, and **optimize approval decisions**.


## ❓ Problem Statement

A fictional credit-lending institution seeks to better understand its customer base, evaluate loan approval patterns, and identify potential financial risks through detailed SQL-driven analysis.

## 🎯 Key Business Questions

1. **Customer Profiling**
   - Who are the top earners per loan type?

   - How many applications were submitted monthly in the last 2 years?

3. **Payment Behavior**
   - How soon do customers make their first payment?
   - Who are the most frequent late payers?
   - When do late payments peak (monthly/quarterly)?

4. **Repayment Tracking**
   - How much has each customer paid over time?
   - What’s each customer’s current balance?
   - What are the first and most recent payment dates?

5. **Operational Insights**
   - What are the most used payment methods by gender/loan type?
   - Which rejected applicants should be reconsidered?

6. **Engagement & Retention**
   - What’s the average number of payments per customer?

## 2. Project Overview

This project analyzes the credit application and repayment behavior of customers from a fictional credit-lending institution. It answers business-critical questions around **loan approvals**, **repayment patterns**, **cumulative risk exposure**, and **data quality** using advanced SQL techniques. The goal is to help the credit company **identify risk-prone customers**, **track loan performance**, and **optimize approval decisions**.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Credit lenders must proactively evaluate **applicant reliability** and **repayment behavior** to avoid loan defaults. This project uses structured data to provide insights such as:

- Who pays late and how often?
- Which loan types or purposes have high or low approval and credit scores?
- Which customers have built a strong repayment record over time?

---

## 📌 Key Insights

### 1. Top Earners by Loan Type
**Howard Padilla**, **Mary Day**, and **Jenifer** are the highest-income customers across loan types. These individuals may represent prime lending candidates for larger or premium loan products.

### 2. Loan Approval Rates by Gender and Loan Type
Approval trends reveal distinct gender-based patterns across different loan types:

- Auto Loans: Female applicants have a higher approval rate (35%) than males (24%), indicating stronger alignment with approval criteria.
- Credit Card Loans: Males lead with a 39% approval rate compared to 32% for females.
- Personal Loans: Males also lead with a 39% approval rate versus 29% for females.
- Mortgage Loans: Females show stronger approval at 41% versus 35% for males.
- Education Loans: Only female applicants are present, with an average approval rate of 32%, which may reflect demographic trends or a data limitation.

### 3. Credit Score by Age Group
- Customers aged 61–70 have the highest average credit score (607), indicating long-term creditworthiness.
- The 21–30 age group follows with an average score of 582, showing early credit responsibility.
- Customers aged 31–60 have lower scores (563–567), likely influenced by mortgages, family expenses, and accumulated debt.

**Implication**: Tailor products by age. Offer premium terms to older customers, support younger customers with long-term products, and assist middle-aged applicants with credit improvement solutions.

### 4. Monthly Loan Application Trends
- October 2023 recorded the highest number of applications (40), likely tied to end-of-year financial planning.
- Other peak months include February 2024 (37), May 2024 (33), September 2023 (32), and March 2025 (30).
- June consistently sees low application volume, e.g., June 2023 (8), June 2024 (23), and June 2025 (10), indicating a seasonal trend.

### 5. Credit Score by Loan Purpose
- Medical loans have the highest average credit score (606), suggesting lower-risk borrowers.
- Travel loans have the lowest average score (553), indicating potentially higher-risk behavior.

### 6. Late Payment Behavior
- Customers with the highest number of late payments include Nathaniel, Stephanie, Joseph, Michael, and Elizabeth.
- These individuals represent repayment risks that may require stricter monitoring or credit limits.

### 7. Cumulative Payments Over Time
Christina Ortiz has the highest cumulative loan repayment total, reflecting consistent and significant payment behavior.

### 8. Payment Frequency

- The top 10 most active loan repayers include:
  Gabrielle Chambers, Maria Jordan, Breanna Hart MD, Kevin Mejia, William Harris, Jessica Miller, Travis Arnold, Nicole Mason, Dawn Rhodes, and Donald Hernandez.

### 9. Payment Date Range
- Payments span from 2022 to 2025, showing the dataset covers multiple loan cycles.

### 10. Onboarding Speed
- Customers take an average of 92 days to make their first payment after loan approval, suggesting delayed repayment initiation.

### 11. Data Quality Issues
- A total of 913 customer records contain missing, blank, or invalid email/phone numbers, which can hinder communication and follow-up.

### 12. Payment Method Patterns
- Bank Transfer is the most used payment method, particularly among male customers and for mortgage loans.

### 13. Seasonal Late Payments
- May has the highest frequency of late payments, followed by April and March, indicating a recurring Q2 repayment challenge.

### 14. Outstanding Balances
Kristen Ballard currently holds the highest outstanding loan balance, potentially warranting attention from the collections or restructuring team.


## ✅ Recommendations

### Credit Strategy
- Flag customers with late payment rates above 80% for risk management or stricter terms.
- Promote medical loans and screen travel loan applications more rigorously based on credit score trends.
- Implement automated re-evaluation of rejected applicants with credit scores above 700.

### Product & Risk Optimization
- Offer age-targeted financial products:
  - Premium offerings for customers aged 60+
  - Credit-building products for ages 21–30
  - Debt-management tools for ages 31–50
- Use seasonal insights to schedule campaigns and allocate operational resources.

### Data & Communication
- Enforce email and phone validation at onboarding to improve data integrity.
- Prioritize follow-up for customers who delay first payments beyond 60–90 days.

### Customer Engagement
- Recognize and retain top-paying customers through loyalty programs or rewards.
- Provide monthly reminders and use preferred payment methods to encourage consistency.
